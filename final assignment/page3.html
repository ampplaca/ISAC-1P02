<p class="moveleft"> The Toronto Maple Leafs are in action tonight against the Calgary Flames in Toronto</br></br>
The Leafs played Calgary just 8 days ago beating them 4-1 in Calgary</br> </br>
Early this morning Kristen Shilton tweeted that Tyler Bozak will be returning to the Leafs lineup after missing Saturdays game with food poisoning </br> </br>

 </p>
<h1 class="moveleft"> <em> December 5th 2017 </em> </h1>
	 <p class="moveleft"> The Leafs have a rare tuesday off today. Mark Masters: When Coach Mike Babcock was asked about if Tyler Bozak will play tomorrow he couldnt give a yes or no answer</br></br>
If Bozak cant play, William Nylander might take his place as Nylander practiced at center for the first time all season
	  </p>
<h1 class="moveleft"> <em> December 4th 2017 </em> </h1>
	<p class="moveleft"> Steve Simmons: Some were wondering why the Maple Leafs didn’t trade Tyler Bozak or James van Riemsdyk for then Ducks defenseman Sami Vatanen.
</br>GM Bob Murray, or any other GM, wouldn’t trade a defenseman like Vatanen who is signed for two more years for a pending UFA like Bozak or van Riemsdyk.</br></br>

It might have taken Nazem Kadri or Connor Brown and something else. Adam Henrique seems like a better fit for the Ducks than what the Leafs could have offered. </p>
<h1 class="moveleft"><em> December 3rd 2017 </em> </h1>
	<p class="moveleft">Last night the Leafs played the Vancouver Canucks and lost 2-1 in regulation </br></br>
	 After getting outshot in the first period 17-11 and down 2-0, the leafs picked up their game allowing just 9 shots and no goals in 40 mintues. unfortunly that wasnt enough as</br> the leafs lone goalscorer was JVR</br></br>
The Leafs are next in action on Wednesday December 6th at home vs the Calgary Flames.
